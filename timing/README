The folder "logs" is updated once every day by rsync from the "maserlog"
computer in the VLBI room, via the 192 network. This uses RSA keys to 
transfer the files without need for password. A cronjob on maserlog runs
the rsync command.
The logs contain the maser drift values approximately every 2 seconds,
as they are read via GPIB from the Agilent counters in the VLBI room.
Once every day, a cronjob on this computer then runs "vlbilog.py" to
create a daily-average file for all days including the last one. The
daily average summary file is then uploaded to the "vlbeer" server
in Bologna, for use by the EVN correlator.
This setup means that either goedel or tycho can be taken offline at any
time, the setup is redundant in that sense. Logs will still be uploaded.
But at least one of goedel/tycho needs to be online.
